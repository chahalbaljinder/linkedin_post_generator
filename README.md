&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;For once, the unflappable Hideo Kojima was overwhelmed. Even close to four decades of game-making experience didn&#39;t prepare him for his biggest tribulation so far: developing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5&quot; data-type=&quot;link&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5&quot;&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; during the covid-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought I can&#39;t pull this off. [I can&#39;t] meet people or scan people, or shoot with people. I almost gave up. And also the staff were all remote, and I became sick as well. I thought it was just the end of the world,&quot; he says through an interpreter as part of a group interview in Sydney. &quot;I&#39;ve been creating games throughout my career, but &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding 2&lt;/em&gt; was the most difficult challenge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Even his initial scouting of Australia, where&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding 2&lt;/em&gt; is predominantly set, had to be carried out remotely via Zoom, with Kojima painstakingly directing a local contact to document the landscape on his behalf. &quot;Looking at it from a camera and to be there is totally different, so that&#39;s disappointing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;For Kojima, those experiences led to a different approach for the sequel. His own sense of isolation that arose from having to develop &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding 2&lt;/em&gt; with a remote team saw him reconsidering its tale - yet it&#39;s also this isolation that led to Koj ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Samsung has announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/691662/samsung-unpacked-july-ultra-foldable&quot;&gt;an Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; that‚Äôs happening on Wednesday, July 9th at 10AM ET. Details are sparse, but it shared the tagline ‚ÄúUltra Unfolds,‚Äù which suggests we‚Äôre about to learn a whole lot more about a premium foldable phone, and perhaps some other foldables. However, you don‚Äôt have to wait for the keynote to unfold to mark yourself as interested, and Samsung is offering a free incentive if you follow through with buying it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;By filling out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://howl.link/kfrvix0ysmuag&quot;&gt;reservation form&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming device, including your full name and e-mail address, you‚Äôll get a $50 credit to the Samsung store following your preorder and purchase of said device. Creating a reservation will set up an alert to ping you when preorders are ready, so you won‚Äôt miss out. You can‚Äôt apply this credit toward the smartphone you‚Äôre purchasing, but can use it on anything else on Samsung‚Äôs site in the future. Registering will also enter you into a sweepstakes to win a $5,000 Samsung gift card.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;As for what we expect to see at this Unpacked event, the announcement‚Äôs graphic and tagline suggest there may be a thin foldable smartphone with the Ultra branding, a title that was previously reserved for its flagship S-series phones. A Samsung press release from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/samsung/679109/looks-like-were-getting-a-foldable-galaxy-ultra&quot;&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; teased a foldable with a ‚Äúpowerful camera,‚Äù which would address a complaint that &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewer Allison Johnson had about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24204714/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-screen-battery-camera&quot;&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 6&lt;/a&gt;. That same press release featured an image titled ‚ÄúGalaxy Z Fold 7 Z Flip 7 Pre tease,‚Äù which corroborates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/618855/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaks-renders-thin-onleaks&quot;&gt;rumors from earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung plans to launch multiple foldables.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/690846/tesla-robotaxi-first-reaction-austin&quot;&gt;Tesla launched&lt;/a&gt; its long-promised robotaxi service in Austin, and almost immediately its vehicles were caught &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/tesla/691061/yep-thats-a-tesla-robotaxi-driving-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-road&quot;&gt;fucking up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s-h0YXtF0c&amp;amp;ab_channel=TeslaDaily&quot;&gt;In a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, a Tesla robotaxi briefly drives on the wrong side of the road. Another video shared by Ed Niedermeyer, the author of a book about Tesla&#39;s origins, shows a robotaxi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpARr8DVU2M&quot;&gt;braking hard in the middle of the road&lt;/a&gt; in response to stationary police vehicles that were not in its immediate driving path. And a third captures a robotaxi dropping off its passengers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1lihl6z/robotaxi_pulls_into_the_middle_of_the/&quot;&gt;the middle of a busy intersection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Typically, when a driverless vehicle makes a mistake or is involved in a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launches an investigation. And that&#39;s just what happened yesterday, when the agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/tesla-robotaxi-videos-show-speeding-driving-into-wrong-lane?embedded-checkout=true&quot;&gt;released a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that said it was reviewing the incident and would &quot;take any necessary actions to protect road safety.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving in the wrong lane, braking hard in the middle of the road, dropping passengers off in the middle of an intersection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;That may leave you with the impression that Tesla has been put on notice. One more mistake, one more close call, and NHTSA will bring the smackdown. Except that&#39;s not really what  ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
