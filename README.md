&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337196/hdmi-2-2-spec-announced-96gbps-audio-sync&quot;&gt;first announcing it at CES 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the HDMI Forum is finally releasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hdmi.org/press/index&quot;&gt;new HDMI 2.2 specification&lt;/a&gt; to manufacturers today. Although there is no definitive timeline for how long it will take hardware makers to adopt the new specification, the first Ultra96 HDMI Cables, with bandwidth capabilities boosted to up to 96Gbps, could be available later this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;HDMI 2.1 and the current Ultra High Speed HDMI cables have a maximum bandwidth of 48Gbps which supports resolutions up to 10K and refresh rates up to 120Hz with 4K content. HDMI 2.2 and the new Ultra96 cables will enable even higher resolutions and refresh rates including 4K at 480Hz, 8K at 240Hz, 10K at 120Hz, and even 16K at 60Hz. It will also handle uncompressed video formats with 10-bit and 12-bit color at 8K at 60Hz and 4K at 240Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/hdmi22_3.jpg?quality=90&amp;#038;strip=all&amp;#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282&quot; alt=&quot;An image comparing video resolutions from 4K up to 16K.&quot; title=&quot;An image comparing video resolutions from 4K up to 16K.&quot; data-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; data-caption=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;HDMI 2.2 and Ultra96 HDMI cables will support video resolutions up to 16K, but it will be a while before we see 16K TVs.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; | Image: HDMI Forum&quot; data-portal-copyright=&quot;Image: HDMI Forum&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Given how difficult it still is to find native 8K content, don‚Äôt expect cable providers or console makers to offer 16K anytime soon. HDMI 2.1 has been around since 2017 and hardware makers still don‚Äôt take full advantage of the spec, so the increased bandwidth and resolutions of 2.2 should help future-proof the HDMI specification for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;The HDMI Forum is also hoping that the new specification will make it easier for consumers to know what cable they need to be using. HDMI cables are currently differentiated with names including Standard, High Speed, Premium High Speed, and Ultra High Speed, which doesn‚Äôt provide any specifics on their capabilities. With HDMI 2.2, the Ultra96 name will make it clear that a cable supports the new specification and bandwidths up to 96Gbps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;HDMI 2.2 will also include the new Latency Indication Protocol &lpar;LIP&rpar;, which was also announced last January. The feature is designed to build on audio and video synchronization improvements introduced with HDMI 2.1, particularly for setups where signals are bouncing through a soundbar or an AV receiver before reaching a TV or projector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Fairphone has announced its latest repairable smartphone, nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23843287/fairphone-5-price-release-date-specs-features-repairable-smartphone&quot;&gt;two years after introducing the last upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairphone.com/&quot;&gt;Fairphone 6&lt;/a&gt; is smaller and 9 percent lighter than its predecessor, but it includes a larger 4,415mAh battery ‚Äî easily replaceable by removing just seven screws ‚Äî that will power the phone for up to 53 hours on a full charge. It‚Äôs also more modular than previous versions, with new accessories like a card holder and finger loop that can be attached to the back of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;The Fairphone 6 is available now through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.fairphone.com/shop-home&quot;&gt;company‚Äôs online store&lt;/a&gt; and other European retailers for ‚Ç¨599 &lpar;around $696&rpar;. There are black, green, and white color options. But as with previous versions dating back to the Fairphone 3, the new model will only be available in the US through &lt;a href=&quot;https://murena.com/&quot;&gt;Murena&lt;/a&gt;, and delivery is expected sometime in August. Instead of running standard Android, the Murena version of the Fairphone 6 will feature a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/31/23144917/murena-one-smartphone-degoogle-android&quot;&gt;privacy-focused and de-Googled version&lt;/a&gt; of Android that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://murena.com/introducing-e-os-3-0/&quot;&gt;company calls /e/OS&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs available for preorder now for $899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/fairphone6_3.jpg?quality=90&amp;#038;strip=all&amp;#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063&quot; alt=&quot;The Fairphone 6 pictured in three color options from the front and back.&quot; title=&quot;The Fairphone 6 pictured in three color options from the front and back.&quot; data-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; data-caption=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Fairphone 6 is available in black, green, and white.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; | Image: Fairphone&quot; data-portal-copyright=&quot;Image: Fairphone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;The Fairphone 6 has a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 mobile processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage that‚Äôs expandable up to 2TB using an SDXC card. It also features a 6.31-inch LTPO OLED display that‚Äôs slightly smaller than the Fairphone 5‚Äôs 6.46-inch screen, but with a refresh rate boosted from 90Hz to 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;On the back, you‚Äôll find a 50MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera, while the front has a 32MP hole-punch camera for selfies and video calls. That‚Äôs a significant step down from the Fairphone 5, which used 50MP sensors on all three of its cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/fairphone6_4.jpg?quality=90&amp;#038;strip=all&amp;#038;crop=0,5.2971132663863,100,89.405773467227&quot; alt=&quot;Two versions of the Fairphone 6 with a lanyard and card holder attached.&quot; title=&quot;Two versions of the Fairphone 6 with a lanyard and card holder attached.&quot; data-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; data-caption=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The lower part of the Fairphone 6‚Äôs back panel can be removed using two screws to attach optional accessories.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; | Image: Fairphone&quot; data-portal-copyright=&quot;Image: Fairphone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;The Fairphone 6‚Äôs physical design is similar to the previous model, although the lenses on the back are no longer located on a small camera bump and instead sit directly on the back panel. That panel is more modular now, allowing the lower section to be removed using just two screws and replaced with alternatives that add more functionality, like a wallet for holding cards or a finger loop for more securely holding the phone with one hand. The idea is similar to the swappable accessories Nothing offers for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/8/24191666/nothing-cmf-phone-1-cases-accessories-lanyard-wallet&quot;&gt;CMF Phone 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/657064/nothing-cmf-phone-pro-2-launch-us-release-price-modules&quot;&gt;Phone Pro 2&lt;/a&gt;, but how useful it will actually be depends on how many accessories Fairphone makes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Repairability is still a priority for Fairphone, and its new phone carries forward the same modular design of past versions. The modular aspect lets you access and swap 12 different parts ‚Äî including the screen, battery, and USB port ‚Äî using just a single standard screwdriver instead of specialized tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;To further extend the Fairphone 6‚Äôs lifespan, the company includes a five-year warranty and promises eight years of software support through 2033. But the downside to not having everything inside the phone being glued in place and sealed tight is that the Fairphone 6 still has a limited IP55 rating for dust and water resistance. It can get splashed or even blasted with a jet of water, but it won‚Äôt survive an accidental submersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Aside from performance improvements and the new modular accessories, Fairphone seems to be staying the course with its latest smartphone, but it is introducing one additional new feature on the software side: Fairphone Moments. Activated through a physical switch on the phone‚Äôs side, it will let you ‚Äútoggle between a full-featured smartphone and a minimalist experience.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;We don‚Äôt know exactly what Fairphone Moments will be minimizing, but since the company describes it as being ‚Äúa mindful way to engage with technology, putting owners in control, not their notifications,‚Äú it sounds like an alternate mode that reduces distractions so you can focus on specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction, June 25th: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article misstated the internal storage of the Fairphone 6. It is 256GB.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
