&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;It has become almost impossible to browse the internet without having an AI-generated video thrust upon you. Open &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/ai-slop-is-a-brute-force-attack-on-the-algorithms-that-control-reality/&quot;&gt;basically any social media platform&lt;/a&gt;, and it won&#39;t be long until an uncanny-looking clip of a fake natural disaster or animals doing impossible things slides across your screen. Most of the videos look absolutely terrible. But they&#39;re almost always accompanied by hundreds, if not thousands, of likes and comments from people insisting that AI-generated content is a new art form that&#39;s going to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;That has been especially true of AI clips that are meant to appear realistic. No matter how strange or aesthetically inconsistent the footage may be, there is usually someone proclaiming that it&#39;s something the entertainment industry should be afraid of. The idea that AI-generated video is both the future of filmmaking and an existential threat to Hollywood has caught on like wildfire among boosters for the relatively new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;The thought of major studios embracing this technology as is feels dubious when you consider that, oftentimes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23770133/secret-invasion-ai-credits-marvel&quot;&gt;AI models&#39; output&lt;/a&gt; simply isn&#39;t the kind of stuff that could be fashioned into a quality movie or series.

And working with policymakers and suppliers to build the energy industry of the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px&quot;&gt;Weâre in the best position to make it happen.

The primary project for this role will be developing software for a fiber optic quench detection system. A quench is an event where a superconducting magnet goes into thermal runaway, and SPARC will incorporate a system using fiber optic cables to detect and mitigate these events. We seek an experienced software engineer &lpar;Senior to Principal level&rpar; to help develop an algorithm for detecting quenches based on the data received by the fiber optic system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;One of the tools used to develop the algorithm is a fiber model written in Python that simulates the expected signals during a quench and nominal operations. The engineer will also help increase the accuracy and performance of the simulation. The development of the fiber model and the quench detection algorithm are informed by experiments, ranging from bench top tests to full sized magnets. The engineer will be responsible for analyzing experimental data from these tests to validate the fiber model and test and develop the quench detection algorithm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you&#39;ll do:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapidly learn and improve complex physics-based models and simulations from first principles optics and physics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhance quench detection algorithm performance &lpar;i.e. reduce quench detection false positive and false negative rates&rpar;, by applying image and signal processing techniques to time-series spectral data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including the physics, production, and SPARC Software &lpar;real-time controls&rpar; teams, to identify and execute on key data and algorithm needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clearly communicate technical results and project progress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement, and maintain CI/CD pipelines to streamline development processes, ensure code reliability, and reduce operational overhead&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What weâre looking for:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelorâs degree in a technical field preferred&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Programming language: Python, including type hinting and object-oriented features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic understanding of numerical methods, linear algebra, and differential equations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the basics of the projectâs physics aspects &lpar;e.g., undergrad-level electromagnetics and optics&rpar;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data analysis using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, or other similar Python packages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with at least one of the following: signal processing, machine learning, and data analytic tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus points for: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Programming languages: C++, Rust, or experience with low-level performance and memory management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concurrency and parallelization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience building a simulation framework that uses physics-based modeling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Must-have Requirements: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform activities such as typing or sitting for extended periods of time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dedication to safety to mitigate industrial hazards that may include heat, cold, noise, fumes, strong magnets, lead &lpar;Pb&rpar;, high voltage, and cryogenics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Willingness to travel or work required nights/weekends/on-call occasionally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;$140,000 - $200,000 a year&lt;/div&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;Salary range for this full-time position + equity + benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;The actual salary will depend on level, location, qualifications, and experience.
