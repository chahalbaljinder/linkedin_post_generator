&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is updating its next-gen 911 network to give users more efficient ways to share important information with emergency services. Starting in October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/2025/att-esinet.html&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T‚Äôs ESInet emergency communications platform&lt;/a&gt; will make it easier for AT&amp;amp;T customers to share pictures and video messages with supported dispatch centers, helping to quickly explain the situation and better prepare first responders who will arrive on the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;The ESInet platform helps 911 dispatch centers process callouts faster and more reliably by replacing traditional analog connections with fiber-based IP networks. Since its launch in 2018, AT&amp;amp;T says 1,700 emergency call centers have now been upgraded to the new communications technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Sending multimedia content to emergency dispatchers is currently a complicated process, but AT&amp;amp;T says the incoming update will make it as effortless as texting family and friends. While AT&amp;amp;T will be the first US carrier to support these capabilities, picture and video messaging will be interoperable with other network providers who choose to integrate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Emergency multimedia messaging support will roll out alongside security features that provide dispatchers with a dedicated private internet connection to access public safety data from the cloud, helping to protect sensitive emergency information from cyber threats. Select 2026 Toyota vehicles equipped with a built-in AT&amp;amp;T Connected Car SIM will also be able to automatically send crash data to emergency dispatchers, including airbag status and precise vehicle location.&lt;/p&gt;
