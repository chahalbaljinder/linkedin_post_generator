&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;In May, we learned that the development of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion&quot;&gt;a sequel to the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; game is moving forward&lt;/a&gt; at CD Projekt Red, and today, at the Anime Expo 2025 event, it officially announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249562/more-cyberpunk-is-coming-to-netflix&quot;&gt;new season&lt;/a&gt; of the anime spinoff for Netflix. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/edgerunners&quot;&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will have “…an entirely new story, fresh characters, and a raw, realistic take on the most dangerous city of the dark future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;On Saturday, Netflix released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjhRSNkquOc&quot;&gt;an official teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that mixes up clips from the first season with the message that “David’s Dead,” plus some concept art-style teases as it moves on to a new set of stories in Night City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/GvCqbhZWkAAxTDa_800.jpg?quality=90&amp;#038;strip=all&amp;#038;crop=0,29.057591623037,100,41.884816753927&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; data-caption=&quot;&quot; data-portal-copyright=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;The new season will be directed by Kai Ikarashi, who also directed episode six in the first season, “Girl on Fire.” There’s no word yet on when &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&lt;/em&gt; will premiere, but they also released this new poster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Showrunner and writer Bartosz Sztybor said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2503793299&quot;&gt;during Friday’s panel&lt;/a&gt; that for season one, “I just wanted to make the whole world sad… when people are sad, I’m a bit happy,” and that this new 10-episode season will be “…of course, sadder, but it will be also darker, more bloody, and more raw.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt; A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51617/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-is-now-in-production&quot;&gt;brief summary&lt;/a&gt; of the follow-up series tells fans what to expect following the end of David’s story in season one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-none&quot;&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 presents a new standalone 10-episode story from the world of Cyberpunk 2077— a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge. In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
